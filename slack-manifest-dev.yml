# Dev-Medic Slack App Manifest (Development/Local)
# =============================================================================
# This manifest creates a separate Slack app for development and testing.
# Using a separate app prevents dev/test notifications from going to production
# channels and allows testing interactive features without affecting production.
#
# To use:
#   1. Go to https://api.slack.com/apps
#   2. Click "Create New App"
#   3. Select "From an app manifest"
#   4. Select your workspace
#   5. Paste this YAML content
#   6. Review and create the app
#   7. Install to your workspace
#
# After creation, you'll need to:
#   - Upload the DEV app icon: docs/assets/medic-icon-dev.png
#     (Basic Information -> Display Information -> App Icon)
#     This icon has a red "DEV" banner to distinguish from production!
#   - Copy the Bot User OAuth Token -> SLACK_API_TOKEN
#   - Copy the Signing Secret -> SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET
#   - Update the interactivity URL (see notes below)
#
# For local development with interactivity:
#   - Use ngrok or similar to expose your local server:
#     ngrok http 8080
#   - Update the request_url to your ngrok URL:
#     https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/v1/slack/interactions
