## Codebase Patterns
- UI project located in ui/ directory
- Use Vite + React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling with Linq brand colors
- shadcn/ui for component library foundation
- React Router v6 for routing
- React Query (TanStack Query) for server state management
- Zustand for client state (theme, settings)
- Geist font family for typography (Geist for body, Geist Mono for code/numerals)
- Dark mode: use #141414 for backgrounds, #FFFFFF for text
- Light mode: use #FCF9E9 (cream) for backgrounds, #141414 for text
- Linq brand colors: navy (#1B3D67), linq-blue (#4F9FDF), linq-green (#83B149), sage (#B0BFB7), lime (#E8DF6E)
- Status colors: healthy (#83B149), warning (#CA8A04 light / #EAB308 dark), error (#DC2626 light / #EF4444 dark)
- API authentication via API key in Authorization header (Bearer token)
- Store API key in sessionStorage, not localStorage

- ESLint 9 uses flat config (eslint.config.js) instead of legacy .eslintrc.js

## 2026-02-04 - US-002 - Linear Issue: SRE-59
- What was implemented: Verified ESLint and Prettier are already configured correctly
- Files changed: None (already complete from prior work)
- ESLint 9 flat config at ui/eslint.config.js with TypeScript, React Hooks, and Prettier integration
- Prettier config at ui/.prettierrc with project conventions
- npm scripts: `lint`, `lint:fix`, `format` all working
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - ESLint 9 uses eslint.config.js (flat config) instead of .eslintrc.js
  - eslint-config-prettier disables ESLint formatting rules that conflict with Prettier
  - Package @typescript-eslint handles TypeScript-specific linting

## 2026-02-04 - US-001 - Linear Issue: SRE-59
- What was implemented: Verified React + Vite + TypeScript project scaffolding is complete; updated App.tsx heading from "Medic" to "Medic UI" per acceptance criteria
- Files changed: ui/src/App.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The ui/ directory was already scaffolded with Vite + React + TypeScript in prior work
  - tsconfig.app.json (not tsconfig.json) contains the strict mode configuration
  - Tailwind CSS and brand colors were already configured in US-003, US-004, US-005
