## Codebase Patterns
- UI project located in ui/ directory
- Use Vite + React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling with Linq brand colors
- shadcn/ui for component library foundation
- React Router v6 for routing
- React Query (TanStack Query) for server state management
- Zustand for client state (theme, settings)
- Geist font family for typography (Geist for body, Geist Mono for code/numerals)
- Dark mode: use #141414 for backgrounds, #FFFFFF for text
- Light mode: use #FCF9E9 (cream) for backgrounds, #141414 for text
- Linq brand colors: navy (#1B3D67), linq-blue (#4F9FDF), linq-green (#83B149), sage (#B0BFB7), lime (#E8DF6E)
- Status colors: healthy (#83B149), warning (#CA8A04 light / #EAB308 dark), error (#DC2626 light / #EF4444 dark)
- API authentication via API key in Authorization header (Bearer token)
- Store API key in sessionStorage, not localStorage

- ESLint 9 uses flat config (eslint.config.js) instead of legacy .eslintrc.js
- For custom fonts in Vite, copy font files to public/fonts/ and reference via /fonts/ path in CSS
- shadcn/ui components installed to src/components/ui/ with path alias @/* -> ./src/*
- cn() utility in src/lib/utils.ts for conditional class merging
- Root .gitignore has `lib/` which ignores ui/src/lib/ - use `git add -f` for lib files

## 2026-02-04 - US-007 - Linear Issue: SRE-86
- What was implemented: Installed shadcn/ui component library with Button and Card components
- Files changed:
  - ui/components.json (new - shadcn/ui configuration)
  - ui/tsconfig.app.json (added path aliases @/* -> ./src/*)
  - ui/vite.config.ts (added path alias resolution)
  - ui/src/lib/utils.ts (new - cn() utility function)
  - ui/src/components/ui/button.tsx (new - shadcn Button component)
  - ui/src/components/ui/card.tsx (new - shadcn Card component)
  - ui/src/index.css (added shadcn/ui CSS variables for theming)
  - ui/tailwind.config.js (added darkMode, color system with CSS variables, borderRadius)
  - ui/eslint.config.js (added rule override for shadcn/ui component exports)
  - ui/package.json (added class-variance-authority, clsx, tailwind-merge, lucide-react, @radix-ui/react-slot)
  - ui/src/App.tsx (updated to demonstrate Button and Card components)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - shadcn CLI creates files in literal `@/` directory - must move to src/components/ui/
  - Tailwind v4 doesn't support `@apply` with custom CSS variable colors like `border-border` - use raw CSS
  - shadcn/ui uses CSS variables for theming - define in :root for light mode, .dark for dark mode
  - Values must be space-separated RGB like `20 20 20` not hex `#141414`
  - ESLint react-refresh rule must be disabled for ui components that export utilities alongside components

## 2026-02-04 - US-006 - Linear Issue: SRE-60
- What was implemented: Installed Geist font family for brand-compliant typography
- Files changed:
  - ui/package.json (added geist dependency)
  - ui/public/fonts/Geist-Variable.woff2 (new)
  - ui/public/fonts/GeistMono-Variable.woff2 (new)
  - ui/src/index.css (added @font-face declarations and --font-sans/--font-mono CSS variables)
  - ui/tailwind.config.js (added fontFamily configuration)
  - ui/src/App.tsx (added font-sans class and font-mono demo)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The `geist` npm package is designed for Next.js - for Vite projects, copy font files to public/fonts/
  - Use variable fonts (Geist-Variable.woff2) for flexibility with font-weight 100-900
  - In Tailwind v4, configure fonts in @theme block with --font-sans and --font-mono CSS variables
  - Also add fontFamily to tailwind.config.js for IDE/TypeScript support

## 2026-02-04 - US-002 - Linear Issue: SRE-59
- What was implemented: Verified ESLint and Prettier are already configured correctly
- Files changed: None (already complete from prior work)
- ESLint 9 flat config at ui/eslint.config.js with TypeScript, React Hooks, and Prettier integration
- Prettier config at ui/.prettierrc with project conventions
- npm scripts: `lint`, `lint:fix`, `format` all working
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - ESLint 9 uses eslint.config.js (flat config) instead of .eslintrc.js
  - eslint-config-prettier disables ESLint formatting rules that conflict with Prettier
  - Package @typescript-eslint handles TypeScript-specific linting
---

## 2026-02-04 - US-001 - Linear Issue: SRE-59
- What was implemented: Verified React + Vite + TypeScript project scaffolding is complete; updated App.tsx heading from "Medic" to "Medic UI" per acceptance criteria
- Files changed: ui/src/App.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The ui/ directory was already scaffolded with Vite + React + TypeScript in prior work
  - tsconfig.app.json (not tsconfig.json) contains the strict mode configuration
  - Tailwind CSS and brand colors were already configured in US-003, US-004, US-005
